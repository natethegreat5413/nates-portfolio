    <p>Born and raised in the great state of Utah which is where I am at currently.  Never believing the traditional University education to be a good fit for me I sought alternative paths for education through trade schools which is how I ended up learning to code.</p><br/>
    <p>I joined the tech industry because I saw all the opportunities it presented and realized it would provide the lifestyle I always wanted.  When I'm not coding I'm always seeking out the best adventures that Utah has to offer.</p></div></div>
